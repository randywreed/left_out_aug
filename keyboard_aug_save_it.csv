"Similarly, Mike Pence is simply interpreting the Bible and applying it to things he believes in, such that America is a Christian state. He never directly states this in the article, however I believe it can be interpreted from his remarks that he is in strong support of Christian Nationalism.

In conclusion, I wondered why Mike Pence and Trump might hold strong senses of Christian Nationalism since that was not mentioned in detail in the article. Of course, personal beliefs play a factor, however those are immeasurable. What is measurable, are the voting statistics for the last election and those voters' religious affiliation. Trump held the majority over Clinton for Protestant/other Christian voters (58%) and for Catholic voters (52%, specifically white Catholic voters (60%). According to this data, I believe it can be reasoned that a potential reason for Pence and Trump's interpretation of the Bible, is to round up support for Americans who may believe similar things.",True

What if a country is not thriving because they simply do not have any wealth in the economy? According to thepublicdiscourse.com being well educated and having health may not sound all that great if the person is depressed and is suffering from addictions. Wealthy countries have a higher risk of social isolation, depression, and loneliness. The government in Britain was frightened when a survey found 14 percent of people “often or always” feel lonely. Combining that, he adds, is critics’ growing awareness of “socially isolating” and “addicting” problems with social media, smartphones, video game culture, etc. Overall, I believe there would be up and downsides to having a life with God/religion. It all really just depends on how someone lives their life.
